    title: 'Mastering System Design Interviews: A Senior Engineer\'s Guide',
    content: `After conducting 200+ system design interviews at top tech companies, here's what separates great candidates from good ones:

**Start with Requirements Clarification**
Never jump straight into drawing boxes and arrows. The first 10 minutes should be spent understanding the problem deeply. Ask about scale, users, features, and constraints.

**Think in Layers**
Break down your system into logical layers: presentation, application, data, and infrastructure. This shows structured thinking and makes complex systems manageable.

**Scale Gradually**
Start with a simple solution that works, then scale it step by step. Don't over-engineer from the beginning. Show how you'd handle 1K users, then 1M, then 100M.

**Know Your Numbers**
Memorize key performance numbers: database read/write speeds, network latency, storage costs. These help you make informed decisions during the interview.

**Trade-offs Are Key**
Every design decision has trade-offs. Explicitly discuss them: consistency vs availability, cost vs performance, complexity vs maintainability.

**Real-World Experience Matters**
Reference actual technologies and patterns you've used. Mention specific databases, caching strategies, and monitoring tools. This shows practical experience.`,

    title: 'Breaking into Product Management: From Engineer to PM',
    content: `My transition from software engineer to product manager taught me valuable lessons about career pivots in tech:

**Leverage Your Technical Background**
Your engineering experience is an asset, not a limitation. Technical PMs are highly valued because they can communicate effectively with engineering teams and make informed technical decisions.

**Develop Business Acumen**
Start reading business publications, understand your company's metrics, and learn how technical decisions impact business outcomes. Take online courses in business strategy and finance.

**Practice Product Thinking**
Begin analyzing products you use daily. Why did they make certain design decisions? How would you improve them? What metrics would you track? This develops your product intuition.

**Build Cross-Functional Relationships**
Start collaborating with designers, marketers, and business stakeholders. Volunteer for cross-functional projects and learn how different teams operate.

**Create a Portfolio**
Document your product-related work: feature specifications, user research, A/B test results, and business impact. This shows your product skills to potential employers.

**Network in Product Communities**
Join product management meetups, online communities, and conferences. Connect with other PMs and learn from their experiences.`,

    title: 'The Art of Learning New Technologies: A Framework for Continuous Growth',
    content: `In 8 years of software development, I've learned dozens of technologies. Here's my proven framework for mastering new tech quickly:

**The 20-80 Rule**
Focus on learning 20% of a technology that gives you 80% of the capability. Start with core concepts, basic syntax, and common patterns before diving into advanced features.

**Build While Learning**
Don't just read documentation or watch tutorials. Build something real, even if it's simple. Hands-on experience accelerates learning and reveals practical challenges.

**Teach to Solidify**
Write blog posts, create tutorials, or explain concepts to colleagues. Teaching forces you to understand deeply and identify knowledge gaps.

**Connect to What You Know**
Relate new concepts to technologies you already understand. This creates mental models and makes learning more intuitive and memorable.

**Join Communities**
Engage with technology communities on Discord, Reddit, or Stack Overflow. Ask questions, help others, and stay updated with best practices.

**Set Learning Goals**
Define specific, measurable goals: "Build a REST API with authentication" rather than "Learn Node.js." This provides direction and motivation.`,
